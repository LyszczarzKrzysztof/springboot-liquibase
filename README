Liquibase to enable several versions of DB.

        main class = com.example.springbootliquibase.SpringbootLiquibaseApplication

            main class = com.example.springbootliquibase.SpringbootLiquibaseApplication
            runs app in prod mode with MySQL DB  - spring recognizes actove profile from VM options,
